                <br>
                <span>Election Map was a project I worked on during the election of 2012 to become familiar with the <a href="http://paperjs.org/" target="_blank">Paper.js</a> and <a href="http://raphaeljs.com" target="_blank">Raphael.js</a> JavaScript libraries. A working version of the app is available </span>
                <a href="https://ericdeb.github.io/election_map_2012/" class="stLink" target="_blank">here</a> and the code is also available on <a href="https://github.com/ericdeb/election_map_2012" class="stLink" target="_blank">github</a><span>.  <b>Mouseover</b> the states once the app loads to see the full effect.</span>

                <br>
                <span>In 2014, before Spotify, I wanted to be able to stream my own music collection from a hosted server.  I found MusicCabinet but didn't like the interface so I did a refactor to improve it.  I got it working and used it for awhile, but it is currently not running.  My changes to the code however, are available on github in a series of Pull Requests <a href="https://github.com/ericdeb/subsonic/pulls" class="stLink" target="_blank">here</a> (broken down for simplicity).  The main pull request with all changes is <a href="https://github.com/ericdeb/subsonic/pull/1" class="stLink" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <span>Back in 2010 my friend and I decided to launch an app to signal social availability in college.  We called it HangChillParty.  It was a fairly complex LAMP stack based app.  It is not running but a youtube demo is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x32se4aeync" class="stLink" target="_blank">here</a> and the code is on <a href="https://github.com/ericdeb/HangChillParty" class="stLink" target="_blank">github</a>

                <br>
                <span>Over the past year I've worked on improving my ability to solve algorithm questions.  Please see my LeetCode <a href="https://leetcode.com/Ecodezfun/" class="stLink" target="_blank">profile</a> for evidence of this.  <b>Please Note:</b> I often use the submission tool as a debugger so my % accepted is not as high as it would be otherwise.  I can usually solve easy/medium questions and am working on improving speed/code accuracy.
